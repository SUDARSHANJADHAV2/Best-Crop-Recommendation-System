This is an ambitious project to build a comprehensive crop recommendation system. Here are some guidelines to follow:

1.  **Project Structure:**
    *   `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
    *   `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration, analysis, and model prototyping.
    *   `src/`: Source code for data processing, model training, and utility functions.
    *   `app/`: Streamlit application code.
    *   `models/`: Saved machine learning models.

2.  **Coding Style:**
    *   Follow PEP 8 for Python code.
    *   Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
    *   Add comments to explain complex logic.

3.  **Dependencies:**
    *   All dependencies should be listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

4.  **Workflow:**
    *   Start with the baseline model and iterate.
    *   Ensure each step is completed and verified before moving to the next.
    *   Prioritize functionality and clarity.
    *   The user has provided a detailed plan. Stick to it as closely as possible.
    *   The user wants the "best" system, so attention to detail and accuracy is crucial.
    *   The user has approved all the steps, so I can proceed with confidence.
